# price_of_health

The goal of price_of_health is to determine the price of healthcare for certain procedures.  The primary focus right now is in the state of Maryland.  The data is "openly" available at https://healthcarequality.mhcc.maryland.gov/public/TopDrgPricingForMaryland, but not in the easiest format.
