# price\_of\_health

The goal of price\_of\_health is to determine the price of healthcare
for certain procedures. The primary focus right now is in the state of
Maryland. The data is “openly” available at
<https://healthcarequality.mhcc.maryland.gov/public/TopDrgPricingForMaryland>,
but not in the easiest format.
